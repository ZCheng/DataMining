CREATE TABLE "genecoors" ("chromosome" CHAR, "start" INTEGER, "end" INTEGER, "strand" BLOB, "geneid" CHAR)

2
SELECT count(*) FROM genecoors where chromosome='Chr1' and strand='+'
Answer: 4681

3
SELECT geneid FROM genecoors where chromosome='Chr4' and start>345000 and end<350000
Answer: AT4G00810

4
b. I would use 'CHAR' for genename and 'VARCHAR' for annotation.
CREATE TABLE "geneannotation" ("genename" CHAR, "annotation" VARCHAR)

5
SELECT genename,annotation FROM geneannotation where genename in (SELECT geneid FROM genecoors where chromosome='Chr1' and strand='+')

6
SELECT count(*) From geneannotation where annotation LIKE '%kinase%'
Answer: 1484

7
SELECT count(*),chromosome FROM genecoors WHERE geneid IN (SELECT genename FROM geneannotation WHERE annotation LIKE '%kinase%') GROUP BY chromosome
Answer: 
411  Chr1
211	Chr2
295	Chr3
240	Chr4
327	Chr5

8
DELETE FROM genecoors WHERE chromosome='ChrC'
